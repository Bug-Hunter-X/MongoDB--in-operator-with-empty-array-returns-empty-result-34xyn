# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns empty result
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with empty arrays. The `$in` operator is intended to match documents where a field's value is present within the specified array. However, when the array is empty, it returns an empty result instead of all documents, which may not be the intended behavior in all scenarios.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is that a query with an empty array in the `$in` operator will always return an empty result. This is unexpected, as one might assume it would behave like a wildcard or return all documents if the array is empty.

## Solution
To address this, alternative approaches should be employed to handle cases involving potentially empty arrays. Depending on the desired outcome, one of the following options can be used:

1. **Check for empty array before querying:** Check the array for emptiness before constructing the query. If the array is empty, use a different query strategy to retrieve all documents.
2. **Conditional Logic:** Utilize conditional logic to determine the appropriate query based on the array's state.
3. **Use $exists Operator:** If you are trying to determine if a field exists regardless of its values, the `$exists` operator is a suitable alternative.
